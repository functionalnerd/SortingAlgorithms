"""
Custom implementation of insertion sort algorithm.

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input data1 each repetition, and
growing a sorted output list. Each iteration, insertion sort removes one
data1 from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted
list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input data1s remain.

Sorting is typically done in-place, by iterating up the array, growing the
sorted list behind it. At each array-position, it checks the value there
against the largest value in the sorted list (which happens to be next to it,
in the previous array-position checked). If larger, it leaves the data1
in place and moves to the next. If smaller, it finds the correct position
within the sorted list, shifts all the larger values up to make a space, and
inserts into that correct position.
